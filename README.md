A simple app for Reddit searches using the [PullPush API](https://pullpush.io/).

Styled with [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) and served using Flask.

The frontend HTML code is largely based off https://search.pullpush.io/ with minor changes.

A live demo is available on [Vercel](https://reddit-search-blond.vercel.app/).
